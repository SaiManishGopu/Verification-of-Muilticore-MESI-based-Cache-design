**About the design**:

The Design is targeted at developing a DUT comprising of L1 and L2 cache systems which can be utilized for undertaking functional verification. The DUT works in an environment which contains 4 processor stubs for each L1, a bus system to carry out transactions among L1 caches and also between L1 & L2, an arbiter to determine bus access, and a stub for main memory. The DUT implements functional aspects of L1 cache coherency protocols and hence may not contain performance upgrades/components. The basic block representation of the system is as shown below:

The basic design specifications are based on following 
1. 32 bit 4 core processor system 
2. L1 cache for each processor with Shared L2 memory. 
3. Communication between L1 & L2 and among L1s happens through system bus. 
4. The Grant/Access of the Bus is decided by an Arbiter 
5. Memory is a stub which is assumed to serve all its requests
6. Physically Indexed Physically Tagged Cache system (PIPT) â€“ no TLB 
7. Data and instruction caches are separated in L1. But L2 is a unified cache. 
8. N-way associative cache: 4-way in L1 and 8-way in L2. 
9. MESI based coherency protocol in L1. 
10. Pseudo LRU replacement policy. 
11. Write-back and write allocate scheme. 
12. No write buffers.


_Note_: The design contains several bugs. More details of the bugs can be found in the Bug Report.pdf in the sim directory.
